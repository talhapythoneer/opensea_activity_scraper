# opensea_activity_scraper

It's a Python(selenium) based scraper to get trade activites for a given collection URL from [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) which is the world's first and largest web3 marketplace for NFTs and crypto collectibles.

# Dependencies:
- Install Python and the following libraries:
1) Scrapy
2) Selenium
3) Xlsxwriter


# Usage:
- Put your target URL in code on line no. 10. 
- Start the code
- It will ask the date limit for scraper to stop
- Enter a date and it will start scraping
- Data file will be generated in the same folder at the end


I have done a few other projects for opensea where I scrapped different attributes of target NFT collecitons. If you need any, you may contact me.


Thanks & Regards
